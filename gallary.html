                The Great Hall in the Hogwarts Castle was the main gathering area in the school, which was located off the Entrance Hall. It was a large hall where students and teachers dined and congregated. Three meals a day were hosted in this hall. The Great Hall
                was the main place where students received their meals and daily owl post. They also held certain special events, such as the Sorting ceremony and the Hallowe'en Feast.</p>

            Students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry go on a few weeks' holidays for the Christmas season — though some students (such as Harry Potter), choose to stay at Hogwarts. Harry enjoyed staying at Hogwarts over Christmas, as the alternative
            was going back to the Dursleys. Christmas is often marked by a feast of some type. Eggnog is often served on or around Christmas-time. For those who stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas holidays, enchantment and extravagance await. Harry Potter
            had fond memories of spending Christmas at Hogwarts, since he never had any fun with the Dursleys. When he and Hermione visited Godric’s Hollow in December 1997, the carols coming from the church reminded him of “Peeves bellowing rude versions
            of carols from inside suits of armour, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater”.

                            The Quidditch World Cup (also called the World Cup or World Championship) has been held every four years since 1473. The competition sees Quidditch teams representing countries around the world to compete for the World Cup, while the International Quidditch Tournament is between regional teams. The tournament has been held every four years since 1473. As with so much else about the wizarding world’s most important sporting competition, many query the accuracy of this statement. As only European teams competed during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, purists prefer to date the Quidditch World Cup’s inception from the seventeenth century when it became open to all continents.

                                    The Triwizard Tournament was a magical contest held between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, each school being represented by one Champion.

                        Professor Minerva McGonagall, O.M. (First Class), was a Scottish half-blood witch, the only daughter of Muggle Robert McGonagall and witch Isobel Ross. She also was the older sister of Malcolm and Robert Jnr. Minerva attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House, but it took the Sorting Hat five and a half minutes to decide if she was Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, which made her a Hatstall. During her seventh year, she was appointed Head Girl.

                                    The Hogwarts Express is the name of the train that ran between London King's Cross Station Platform 9¾ and Hogsmeade station. It made this run about six times a year, maybe more, as needed. The Express dutifully carried students to and from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the start and end of every term.
                                    The train left Platform 9¾ without fail every 1 September at 11 o'clock in the morning, arriving at Hogsmeade station in the early evening. Some students took the train back to King's Cross Station to go home for the Christmas and Easter holidays, but some did not, as they stayed at Hogwarts. It also made the run back again to London at the end of term in June.
